One thing
I don't know why?
It doesn't even matter how hard you try.
Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme to explain in due time.
All I know...

Time is a valuable thing!
Watch it fly by as a pendulum swings,
Watch it count down to the end of the day the clock ticks life away... It's so unreal!
